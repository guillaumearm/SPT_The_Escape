# Expanded Cases

## This mod is an replacement of Revingly's Bigger Key Tool Mod.

This mod expands some cases that I found, personally, a bit too small. 

The cases expanded include the following: 
    - Money Case (10x10)
    - Keycard Holder (5x7)
    - Key Tool (from Revingly's Bigger Key Tool Mod) (14x14)
    - Medicine Case (8x9)
    - Magazine Case (9x9)
    - Ammunition Case (8x9)
    - Injectors Case (6x6)
    - THICC Weapons Case (8x16)
    - Weapons Case (7x10)

    I have also changed the GP Coin Stack Size to 100. (By Default in config)

    Yes, you can use SVM to achieve similar results. I just know there are a lot of players that do not like SVM, like myself.
