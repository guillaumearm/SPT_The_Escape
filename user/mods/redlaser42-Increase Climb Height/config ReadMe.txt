Here are the game's defaults with my experience tweaking them:

  "InteractMaxHeight": 1.31,
  This one setting is 99% of the mod. It's the height a climb will be attempted. You could bump this up to make things feel more grippy, but how high your character moves up won't change. 
  
  "InteractMaxLength": 10,
  This is how close in front of you a wall needs to be to attempt a climb. I left this at default. It didn't help get to more ledges because where you climb up to does not go further out. 
  
  "MinDistantToInteract": 0.5,
  IDK what this does but was with the other two. Didn't notice any effect. 
  

  "BaseJumpPenalty": 0.3,
  Inertia penalty for jumping. I set this to 0 for off. 

  "MaxOneHandAnimationHeight": 2.3,
  How high a the one handed climb animation transitions into a two handed climb. One hands are slightly faster, so this could be boosted, but wouldn't above 3.5. I left this at default.
  
  "MaxWithoutHandHeight": 0.65,
  How high you can do a no-handed step up. I left this at default. Looks wonky past 2
   

  "VaultingInputTime": 0.5,
  I didn't notice an effect lowering this to 0. I could still vault as quick as I could press a key. 

  "AnimationVerticalSpeed": 1.1,
  "AnimationForwardSpeed": 0.8,
  How fast you climb. Left at default. Adjust .1 at a time. 
  
  
  "GridOffsetX": 0,
  "GridOffsetY": 0,
  "GridOffsetZ": 0,
  "GridSizeX": 0,
  "GridSizeY": 1.8,
  "GridSizeZ": 2,
  "OffsetFactor": 0.1,
  "SteppingLengthX": 0.1,
  "SteppingLengthY": 0.1,
  "SteppingLengthZ": 0.1
  Everything above is under "Grid Settings". I tweaked these settings, but it was hard to tell what was happening. 
  I didn't notice any effect except making the grid too small or large prevents you from climbing. Left all at defaults.
